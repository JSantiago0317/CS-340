To write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I try not to focus on any particular operating system. I tried to create my code with only the database I was working with in mind and not any specific technologies. I approach problems by using the trial and error method. I am still a beginner as a programmer, so I don't have a great idea of what will work and what will not. To deal with this problem I try to write small chunks of code and test often to see how I am doing. Computer scientists are the people that are in charge of creating technology that can manipulate data. It matters because in today's world, the internet is so vast and has the potential to be applied to many fields across nearly all discplines imaginable and computer scientists are the architects behind the programs that use the internet.
